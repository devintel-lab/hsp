# Human Similarity Judgement JSpsych version - hsp
Version of HSP where participants rate the similarity of two verbs (gathered from participants' responses in previous HSP experiments) on a likert scale from 1 to 7.
A maximum of 300 word pairs for each of the 27 conditions, which would take around 20 minutes to complete.
Each condition is symmetric; 150 unique word pairs, with the reverse ordering doubling the amount to 300.
