    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p align=""justify"">You will be asked to look over word pairs and give a similarity judgement. These are concrete action verbs parents likely say to their children in a toy-play context. Your job is to carefully rate the similarity of the two words on a scale from 1 to 7 (1 = Not similar at all, 7 = Almost identical).</p>

    <p align=""justify"">The study session will last 20 or so min, please make sure you have enough time to finish the study in one session. There will be no breaks in between.</p>
